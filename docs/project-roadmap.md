## Key Initiatives

### 1. Marketplace (Highest Priority)
**Rationale:** Unlock web-based user growth and license upsell.
**Ownership:** Product + Web team
**Risk:** Authentication complexity, payment integration
**Mitigation:** Use Supabase (auth + DB) to accelerate

### 2. Community Interns (Medium Priority)
**Rationale:** Expand intern catalog without building more ourselves.
**Ownership:** Community + Moderation team
**Risk:** Quality control, marketplace spam
**Mitigation:** Initial human review, ratings system, report feature

### 3. Customization (Medium Priority)
**Rationale:** Increase stickiness and allow power users to tailor interns.
**Ownership:** Product + Frontend team
**Risk:** UI complexity, personality compilation bugs
**Mitigation:** Start with neural matrix slider, expand later

### 4. Analytics (Low Priority for MVP)
**Rationale:** Understand usage patterns for future product decisions.
**Ownership:** Data + Analytics team
**Risk:** Privacy concerns, telemetry opt-out required
**Mitigation:** Clear opt-in, anonymous data, no PII

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Database choice for marketplace** — PostgreSQL (Supabase) vs. other? *(Recommend Supabase for speed)*
2. **Payment flow** — Keep Lemon Squeezy or migrate to Stripe? *(Stay with Lemon Squeezy for MVP)*
3. **Community moderation** — Human review vs. automated checks? *(Hybrid: automated schema check + 24h human review)*
4. **Mobile strategy** — React Native vs. native per-platform? *(Defer to 2027, revisit after web MVP)*
5. **Data privacy** — GDPR compliance scope? *(In-scope when user accounts launch; privacy policy required)*

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External
- Lemon Squeezy API stability (license validation)
- Vercel availability (landing page)
- GitHub API (intern bundle distribution)

### Internal
- Core library stability (no breaking AIEOS changes planned)
- CLI backward compatibility (important for installed user base)
