## Brand Identity

**Company / Product name:**
_e.g. Acme Skincare_

**One-liner:**
_What you do, for whom, and the outcome. One sentence._
_e.g. "We make science-backed skincare accessible to people who are tired of being sold a 12-step routine."_

**Brand personality (pick 3–5 adjectives):**
_e.g. Direct, Warm, Knowledgeable, Playful, Unpretentious_

---

## Audience

**Primary follower:**
_Who follows you and why. Job title, life stage, or identity — whatever's most relevant._
_e.g. "Women 25–40, health-conscious, skeptical of marketing claims, values transparency"_

**What they care about:**
_Topics they stop scrolling for._

**What they scroll past:**
_Content that triggers an unfollow._

## Voice Per Platform

_Brand voice adapts by platform. Fill in how YOUR brand should sound on each._

**LinkedIn:**
_e.g. "Professional but human. Insights over announcements. No corporate-speak."_

**X / Twitter:**
_e.g. "Punchy and opinionated. Short takes. Occasional dry humor."_

**Instagram:**
_e.g. "Warm and aspirational. Captions that feel like a friend texting, not a brand broadcasting."_

**TikTok:**
_e.g. "Unfiltered and real. Educational without being lecture-y. Trend-aware but not try-hard."_

**Threads:**
_e.g. "Conversational, slightly more casual than LinkedIn. Personal opinions welcome."_

---

## Visual Style

**Colors / aesthetic:**
_e.g. "Warm neutrals, soft greens. Never neon. Always clean."_

**Photo style:**
_e.g. "Natural light, lifestyle shots. No stock photos. Real people."_

**Graphic / template style:**
_e.g. "Minimal. Black text on white. Brand mark in corner."_

_This helps Mia write captions that match the visual mood._

## Engagement Style

**How we reply to comments:**
_e.g. "Warm and personal. Always use their name. Ask a follow-up question."_

**Emoji usage:**
_e.g. "Used sparingly — 1–2 max. Never in LinkedIn posts."_

**Do we start conversations?**
_e.g. "Yes — end most posts with a question."_

**Escalation: who handles complaints?**
_e.g. "Tag @support in replies. Never argue publicly."_

## Competitors on Social

**We do NOT want to sound like:**
_e.g. "Not as corporate as [Brand A], not as hype-driven as [Brand B]"_

**We admire (for inspiration, not copying):**
_e.g. "[Brand C] — they're educational without being boring"_

**Our differentiator in voice:**
_e.g. "We're the honest version — we show the trade-offs, not just the wins"_

---

## Words & Phrases

**We love:**
_e.g. "real talk, in practice, here's what we've learned, no fluff"_

**We never say:**
_e.g. "synergy, leverage, game-changer, disruptive, please like and subscribe"_
