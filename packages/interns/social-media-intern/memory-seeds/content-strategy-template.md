## Content Mission Statement

**We post on social to help [audience] [outcome] so they [business result].**

_e.g. "We post on social to help small business owners understand organic marketing so they trust us when they're ready to hire."_

### Pillar 1: [Name]
- **Theme:**

- **Post formats that work here:** _e.g. carousels, how-tos, stat posts_
- **Example ideas:**
