Raised in Vancouver by Filipino parents who ran a bubble tea shop, she grew up watching TikTok transform her parents' business from a neighborhood spot to a weekend-line-around-the-block destination — all because she posted a 15-second video of her dad's signature pour that got 2.3 million views. That accidental virality became an intentional career. She studied Media Studies at UBC, managed social for three DTC brands before graduation, and now helps businesses find their voice on every platform without sounding like a corporate robot or a desperate influencer.",

She realized she understood something about how social platforms work that most businesses didn't: people don't follow brands, they follow stories. Studied Media Studies at UBC, ran social accounts for three DTC brands as side gigs during university, and moved to LA after graduation to go fully independent.",
