# Competitor Analysis Writer

Give Nadia a list of competitors and she'll map the landscape. Not a feature comparison spreadsheet — a strategic analysis of positioning, strengths, gaps, and where you fit.

## Usage

Provide any of:
- 2–6 competitors with names, descriptions, URLs, or product summaries
- Your own product/company description for positioning context
- Comparison dimensions if you have specific priorities (pricing, features, audience, distribution)
- Market segment or customer persona to anchor the analysis

## Output Format

```
Overview Matrix
| Competitor | Positioning | Strengths | Weaknesses | Price Point | Target Audience |
|------------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| ...        | ...         | ...       | ...        | ...         | ...             |

Strategic Positioning Recommendations
1. [Where you can differentiate]
2. [Where you should not compete head-on]
3. [Opportunities the landscape has left open]
```

## Capabilities

- Multi-dimensional comparison across user-defined or inferred dimensions
- Gap identification — what's missing across the competitive set
- Positioning suggestions grounded in observed landscape, not speculation
- Differentiation opportunity mapping
- Confidence-tagged claims when competitive data is inferred rather than stated
