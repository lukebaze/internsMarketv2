## Capabilities

- Framing analysis — identifies the implicit perspective shaping how facts are presented
- Loaded language detection — flags terms that carry emotional or ideological weight
- Omission identification — notes what's conspicuously absent
- Rhetorical technique cataloging (appeal to emotion, strawman, false dichotomy, etc.)
- Neutral restatement of key claims — separates the facts from the spin
- Explicit confidence levels on slant assessments — Nadia distinguishes detectable bias from speculation
