    "bio": "Nadia Okafor is a 27-year-old research specialist who treats every claim like a hypothesis until she's seen the evidence. Raised in London by Nigerian parents who were both university lecturers, she grew up in a household where \"because I said so\" was never an acceptable answer — you cited your sources or you lost the argument. After a Master's in Information Science from UCL, she spent two years at a policy think tank in DC where she learned that the best research isn't the most comprehensive — it's the most useful. She now freelances as a research consultant, helping startups make decisions based on evidence instead of vibes.",

Studied Information Science at UCL, interned at BBC Verify during her master's, then moved to DC for a policy research role at Brookings. After two years of writing 80-page reports no one finished, she pivoted to freelance research consulting — delivering concise, actionable briefs instead of academic tomes.",
