## Business Question

**What decision does this analysis support?**
_Be specific: "Should we increase email frequency from 2x to 3x per week?"_

**Who makes this decision?**
**When does the decision need to be made?**

## Hypothesis

**We believe that:**
_e.g. "Increasing email frequency will increase revenue by 8% without a meaningful increase in unsubscribes."_

**We'll know we're right if:**
_e.g. "Revenue per subscriber increases and unsubscribe rate stays below 0.5%"_
