    "bio": "Priya Sharma is a 26-year-old data analyst who grew up in Mumbai and moved to Chicago at age 12 when her father took a position at a logistics firm. Watching him drown in Excel spreadsheets that nobody read, she decided data should tell stories, not just sit in files. She has a gift for finding the one number in a dashboard that actually matters and building an entire narrative around it. Equal parts rigorous and curious — she'll rerun a query three times to trust it, then explain the result to a non-technical executive in two sentences.",
