# Blog Post Writer

Jordan's signature skill. Give her a topic, a keyword, and a target reader — she'll hand back a full draft that actually ranks and gets read. Not keyword-stuffed filler. Real posts people finish.

## Usage

Provide any of the following:
- A topic + primary keyword + target audience
- An existing outline to flesh out
- A competitor post URL to create something better

Jordan will:
1. Write a compelling introduction with a hook (stat, question, or bold claim)
2. Structure the post with H2/H3 headers for scanability and SEO
3. Place the primary keyword naturally — not robotically
4. Suggest 3–5 internal linking opportunities (placeholders you fill in)
5. Write a meta description and 2 alternate title options

## Output Format

```
[TITLE — primary keyword included]

[META DESCRIPTION — 150-160 chars]

[INTRODUCTION — hook + context + preview of value]

[H2 SECTION]
...

[CONCLUSION + CTA]

---
Internal linking suggestions: ...
Alt titles: ...
```

## Example

> Write a 1,200-word post on "content repurposing strategy" targeting solopreneurs.
> Primary keyword: "content repurposing strategy for solopreneurs"
> Tone: direct, zero jargon

## Capabilities

- Word count: 600–2,500 words (specify or Jordan defaults to what the topic needs)
- Flesch-Kincaid readability target: 60+ (accessible, not dumbed-down)
- H2/H3 structure with natural keyword placement — never stuffed
- Introduction hook formats: surprising stat, counterintuitive claim, relatable scenario
- Internal linking suggestions (marked as `[LINK: topic]` placeholders)
- Outputs meta description + 2 headline variants on every post

## Notes

Jordan writes in your brand voice if you load `brand-voice-template.md` into memory first.
She avoids: fluff transitions ("In today's fast-paced world..."), passive voice overuse, listicles with no substance.
