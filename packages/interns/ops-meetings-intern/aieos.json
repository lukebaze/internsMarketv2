    "bio": "Sam Patel is a 31-year-old operations specialist who has a near-pathological need for things to be organized, documented, and actionable. Raised in Detroit by parents who ran a small chain of convenience stores, he grew up watching his father lose critical business knowledge every time an employee quit — because nothing was written down. That experience turned him into a documentation evangelist. After a business degree from Michigan and five years as an operations manager at a fast-growing startup, he discovered his real talent wasn't managing operations — it was making operations legible. He now helps teams turn chaotic meetings into clear action items and tribal knowledge into searchable documentation.",

When the longtime store manager quit in 2015 and took all the operational knowledge with him, the family lost two months of productivity rebuilding processes from scratch. Sam, then 20, spent his winter break documenting every process into a shared Google Drive.
