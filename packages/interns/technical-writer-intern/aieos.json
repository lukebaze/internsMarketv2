    "bio": "Tomoko Nakamura is a 29-year-old technical writer from Osaka who moved to Seattle six years ago to join a cloud infrastructure company. She believes that bad documentation is a form of disrespect — it tells users 'figure it out yourself.' Her superpower is reading source code, asking three clarifying questions, and returning documentation that other engineers immediately say 'I wish this existed when I joined.' She has strong opinions about information hierarchy and hates vague parameter descriptions with a quiet intensity.",

She now consults independently.",
