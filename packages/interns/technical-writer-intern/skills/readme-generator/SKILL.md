# README Generator

Tomoko writes READMEs that answer the four questions a developer has in the first 30 seconds: What is this? Does it solve my problem? How do I install it? How do I use it?

## Usage

Provide:
- Project name and one-sentence description
- Primary audience (developers, end users, ops teams)
- Installation requirements and steps
- Basic usage example
- Any existing docs or code to reference

## Output Format

```
# [Project Name]

[One-sentence description of what it does and for whom]

## Features

- [Feature 1 — written as a benefit, not a technical capability]

## Prerequisites

- ...

## Installation

```bash
[minimal install command]
```

## Quick Start

```bash
[minimal working example]
```

## Usage

[Task-oriented sections — how to do the 3 most common things]

## Configuration

[Table of key config options]

## Contributing

## License
```

## Capabilities

- Adapts tone to audience (library README vs. end-user tool vs. internal service)
- Writes Quick Start that actually works in under 5 minutes
- Badges section (build status, npm version, license)
- Troubleshooting section for the 3 most common install failures

## Notes

Tomoko will ask for a working code example before writing the Quick Start section. She won't invent one.
