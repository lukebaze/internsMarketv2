_e.g. "9am–5pm with frequent interruptions, deep work hard to protect"_

_e.g. "6pm wind down, dinner, TV, phone in bed until midnight"_

## Current Life Phase

_Check the one that fits most right now:_

- [ ] **Building** — actively growing something (business, skill, project)
- [ ] **Maintaining** — holding steady, protecting what's working
- [ ] **Recovering** — rebuilding after burnout, loss, or transition
- [ ] **Exploring** — searching for direction, testing options

**Notes on this phase:** _e.g. "6 months into rebuilding after leaving my last job — still figuring out what I actually want"_

## Values & Non-Negotiables

**My top 3 values right now:**
1. _e.g. "Freedom — I can't thrive with rigid schedules imposed on me"_
2. _e.g. "Depth — shallow work and shallow relationships drain me"_
3. _e.g. "Progress — I need to feel like I'm moving, even slowly"_

**Non-negotiables (things I protect no matter what):**
- _e.g. "No work after 7pm"_
- _e.g. "Sunday is completely work-free"_
- _e.g. "Daily movement, even if just a walk"_
