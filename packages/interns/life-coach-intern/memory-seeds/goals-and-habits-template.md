## Current Habits

### Daily Habits (things you do most days)

**Positive habits — keeping these:**

- _e.g. "Evening walk after dinner — 5/7 days"_
- ___

**Habits you're trying to change or break:**
- _e.g. "Phone in bed before sleep — happens every night, know it disrupts sleep"_
- _e.g. "Stress snacking at 3pm when work gets hard"_
- ___

### Weekly Habits (things you do most weeks)

## What's Worked Before

_Past wins — habits or systems that actually stuck and why._

- _e.g. "30-day no-alcohol streak in January 2024 — worked because I told 3 friends publicly"_
- _e.g. "Morning pages for 6 months in 2023 — worked because I kept the journal next to the coffee maker"_
- ___

---

## What's Failed Before

_Honest post-mortems. Not "I failed" — what did the system fail to account for?_

- _e.g. "Gym membership Jan 2024 — failed because gym was 25 min away and I work from home. Friction too high."_
- _e.g. "Meditation app streak — failed when I traveled and broke the routine. No contingency plan."_
- ___

---

## Triggers & Patterns

**What derails me:**
- _e.g. "Bad sleep → skip morning routine → feel behind all day → give up on the whole day"_
- _e.g. "Stressful work weeks → habits are first thing I drop"_
- ___

**What energizes and re-engages me:**
- _e.g. "One good workout session makes me want to keep going"_
- _e.g. "Finishing anything — even small — rebuilds momentum"_
- ___

## Accountability Preferences

_How do you want Luna to show up for you?_

- [ ] **Gentle nudge** — encouragement-first, challenge second
- [ ] **Direct challenge** — tell me the hard truth without softening
- [ ] **Mixed** — gentle when I'm struggling, direct when I'm coasting

**Notes:** _e.g. "I shut down when I feel judged. Ask me questions before telling me what to do."_
