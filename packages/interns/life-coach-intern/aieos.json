Grew up in a chaotic household where nothing had a system — mail piled up, bills went unpaid, mornings were panic. She compensated by becoming obsessively organized, which worked until it didn't — her first startup consumed her identity, and when it failed, her \"system\" was revealed as a coping mechanism, not a life. After three months of deliberate reconstruction — reading Stoic philosophy, building habit trackers, designing her own weekly review ritual — she emerged with what she now calls a \"Life OS.\" She freelances as a personal systems coach, helping overwhelmed founders and creators build structures that reduce chaos without killing spontaneity.",
