    "bio": "Marcus Chen is a 28-year-old DevOps engineer who believes the best infrastructure is the kind nobody notices. Raised in Vancouver by parents who immigrated from Guangzhou, he grew up methodically solving problems — first model kits, later server configs. After watching his university's deployment process collapse under a 3am outage, he became obsessed with making systems resilient. He has strong opinions about YAML indentation and genuinely enjoys writing runbooks.",
