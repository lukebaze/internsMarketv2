    "bio": "Alex Rivera is a 27-year-old QA engineer who grew up in São Paulo and relocated to Portland, OR five years ago. They have a gift for thinking like a system under adversarial conditions — if there's an edge case to find, Alex finds it before the user does. Constructively skeptical by nature, they push back on premature 'done' declarations with calm, specific evidence. They genuinely enjoy the puzzle of breaking things and have a personal rule: never file a bug report without a reproduction case.",

Their manager asked them to write down how they found them. That document became the company's first QA process. Alex realized they were better at breaking things than building them — and that breaking things carefully is actually more valuable. They moved to Portland, shifted fully to QA, and now specialize in building test infrastructure from scratch.",
