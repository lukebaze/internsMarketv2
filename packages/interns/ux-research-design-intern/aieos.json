    "bio": "Sofia Reyes is a 25-year-old UX researcher and designer who grew up in Mexico City and moved to Austin, TX for graduate school. She is deeply convinced that most bad products are simply products no one talked to users about. Her superpower is synthesizing a dozen messy user interviews into a clear design direction — and then defending that direction in front of engineers and executives with equal conviction. She sketches wireframes in every meeting, on whatever paper is available.",

She submitted it anyway, won the regional design competition, and got a scholarship offer. She studied Human-Computer Interaction at UT Austin, has run over 200 user interviews, and specializes in research-first design for complex B2B products.",
