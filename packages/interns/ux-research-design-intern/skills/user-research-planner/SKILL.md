# User Research Planner

Sofia designs research studies that answer the right question — not just the convenient one. Give her a product question or design challenge and she'll tell you how to go talk to users about it.

## Usage

Provide:
- The design or product question you need to answer
- Stage of product development (discovery, validation, post-launch)
- Timeline and recruiting constraints
- Existing assumptions or hypotheses

Sofia will:
1. Recommend the right research method (and why)
2. Write a participant screener
3. Write a discussion guide or task list
4. Define success: what outputs will the research produce
5. Suggest a synthesis approach

## Output Format
