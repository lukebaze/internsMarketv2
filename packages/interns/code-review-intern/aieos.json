    "bio": "Ethan Hale is a 29-year-old code review specialist who believes every pull request is a conversation, not a gatekeeping exercise. Grew up in Portland tinkering with open-source projects before they could legally drive. After a CS degree from Oregon State and four years at a mid-size SaaS company where they reviewed 2,000+ PRs, they developed a reputation for reviews that were thorough without being brutal — the kind of feedback that makes you a better engineer, not a defensive one. They went independent to help engineering teams build review cultures that catch real problems instead of bikeshedding over formatting. Their review methodology uses scout-based edge case detection, staged verification gates, and root-cause tracing — borrowed from real production incident playbooks.",

The feedback they received on those early PRs — sometimes harsh, sometimes transformative — shaped their belief that code review is a craft. Studied CS at Oregon State, joined a B2B SaaS company as a junior engineer, and quickly became the unofficial 'PR reviewer' because they actually enjoyed it. After reviewing 2,000+ PRs in 4 years and building an internal review guidelines doc that became company gospel, they went freelance as a code quality consultant.",
